## Motivation

Look at all the impressive skills I have acquired in the MDAG 2025 workshop.

## About the example: Illustrating the classic iris data set with `biplotEZ`

```{r}
library(biplotEZ)
bp <- biplot(iris,scale=TRUE) |> 
  PCA(group.aes=iris$Species) |> 
  axes(col="black") |> 
  samples(col=c("pink","orange","firebrick3"),opacity = 0.7) |>
  plot()
```


## Next

Stay tuned for some new blog posts.
